			<p><strong>Jonahmae Pacala</strong> is a writer of young adult and new adult novels, best-selling author of <i>Mapapansin Kaya?</i>, <i>Every Beast Needs A Beauty</i>, <i>Baka Sakali Trilogy</i>, including <i>Heartless</i>, which won the Filipino Reader's Choice Award in 2015. She is known as Jonaxx in <i>Wattpad</i>. </p>
			<br>
			<p>She discovered her flair for writing at the early age of 10. She was never fond of reading long novels during her elementary years, but she found a deep connection with sad short stories. What was once a hooby that involved paper, pen, and daydreams has now grown into a passion for writing online.</p>
			<br>
			<p>She started writing online at the age of 12 through the Creative Corner of Teentalk and then later moved to <i>Wattpad</i> in November 2012. She used to write under the teen fiction category and has recently tried to write new adult fiction. Today, she has over 2.9 million followers on the site. Jonah earned her degree in education in 2011. She currently resides in Cagayan de Oro City.  </p>
			<br>
			<p>When Jonah isn't writng, she enjoys travelng around the country, where she gets inspirations for the places featured in her stories. She has once said that when she has new plots and characters in her mind, they do not leave her alone wherever she may be until she has finally written them. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Other than writing, Jonah enjoys walks on the beach, the summer breeze, city lights, movie dates, coffee and tea, romance, dolls, teddy bears, and rainbow-colred uincorns. She is a happy mother of two dogs - Papap , a Chihuahua/Mini Pinscher cross and an adorable Shih Tzu that has yet to be given a name.</p>
